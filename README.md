Telco Customer Churn Data Pipeline 
AWS Cloud Data Engineering Project 

I want to share my latest Data Engineering project where I put my skills to the test by working with an AWS cloud using Databricks and load into BI tools.

🔬𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: End-to-end data engineering on AWS. Where I ingested data from S3 to Redshift using Glue, transformed it with Glue, loaded it into Athena and Redshift, and reported with BI tools. Also used IAM and VPC for data governance. More information can be found in the GitHub repository.
